IMPROVING GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORK FOR SUPER RESOLUTION

The task of generating high-resolution image from its corresponding low-resolution input image is referred to as image super-resolution. I started by implementing the SRGAN paper by Ledig et al. Then I tried different model architecture and training strategies to get better results.

You can find the code for both implementations in provided notebooks. Details about the approach and results are provided in the report and presentation.
